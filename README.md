# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to create insightful dashboards for two distinct topics:
- **Festive Analysis of Crime Data**: A dashboard that analyzes crime data during festive periods, identifying trends, hotspots, and other patterns related to crime occurrences around festivals.
- **E-Commerce Dashboard**: A dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) for an e-commerce platform, providing insights into sales, product performance, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

## Project Overview
### Festive Analysis of Crime Data
The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize and analyze crime data during festive seasons to identify any patterns, correlations, or anomalies in criminal activities during these periods. The dashboard includes insights such as:

- Crime rates and trends during specific festivals.
- Hotspot locations of crimes.
- Analysis of crime types (violent, property, etc.) during festive times.
- Comparing crime rates before, during, and after major festivals.

### E-Commerce Dashboard
This dashboard focuses on analyzing the performance of an e-commerce platform. The dashboard provides insights on:

- Sales figures, revenue generation, and order trends.
- Product performance by category, region, and sales volume.
- Customer behavior including average cart value, purchase frequency, and demographics.
- Performance analysis by various metrics (e.g., customer acquisition, return rate, etc.).

### Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: for data analysis, creating interactive dashboards, and visualizations.
- **Excel / CSV**: for data input and pre-processing (optional).
- **Power Query**: for transforming and cleaning the data before analysis.
- **DAX**: for creating calculated columns, measures, and KPIs within Power BI.
